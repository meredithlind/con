#### Welcome to my attempt at Connect Four

A few notes:
Unfortunately, I was unable to get the game board to update during the game play, so there is no visual indication of the moves that are being made. To make up for this, I added some logging in the console to show that progress is being made. I also decided to start with a partially full game board to display the styling of the discs as a player claims them. Lastly, I ran out of time to fill out the logic surrounding winning, so the program executes until the game board is full.

Thanks for playing!
